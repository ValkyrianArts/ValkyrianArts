- 👋 Hi, I’m Valcyrie, brand new to this but with a curiosity as big as my glasses.
- 👀 I got into beginner HTML, CSS & JavaScript about 20 years ago and thought it was fun, but lost touch, and now I'm back at it! Otherwise I'm a huge nerd who loves D&D and other stuff. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development (focus on Front end cuz that's what I like the most) through #TheOdinProject.
- 💞️ Commissions/collabs closed. I'm too green o.o'
- 📫 You can find me on BlueSky (https://bsky.app/profile/valkyrianarts.bsky.social), Discord (valcyrie) or through my linktree: https://linktr.ee/valkyrianarts
